//! The Commander X16 (also known as the X16) is a modern hardware platform being development.
//! It is built from modern, mostly off-the-shelf parts, with KERNAL
//! compatibility with the Commodore family of computers. It was initiated by David "the 8 Bit Guy" Murray,
//! who wanted an accessible and affordable platform with late-80s sound and graphics.
